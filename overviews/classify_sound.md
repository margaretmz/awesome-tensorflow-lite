# Sound classification

Teachable Machine (TM) offers a no-code [solution](https://medium.com/@warronbebster/teachable-machine-tutorial-snap-clap-whistle-4212fd7f3555) to train a sound classifier and exporting the model to TensorFlow Lite.

Current status: blocked by FFT support on TF Lite. Waiting for TF team to resolve.
